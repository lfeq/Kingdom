# My first game using GODOT

This is my first game in GODOT. I'm trying to make a game like 
[Kingdom: Two Crowns](https://store.steampowered.com/app/701160/Kingdom_Two_Crowns/) but with a little more city building. I'm giving myself two weeks to finish the project (24/06/2024 to 08/07/2024)
Wish me luck!
